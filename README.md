# Sentiment-analysis-of-Amazon-product-reviews-and-Tweets
This repository contains two projects: 1) Sentiment analysis of Amazon customer reviews, 2) Tweets. I have implemented textual feature extraction and traditional NLP methods and applied Deep Learning methods for these projects.


# Amazon Reviews Sentiment analysis.
